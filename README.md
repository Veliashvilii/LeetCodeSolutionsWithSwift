# LeetCode Solutions With Swift

This repository contains various solutions to LeetCode problems. Each problem includes different approaches and performance evaluations of those approaches. Also repository has compares to different solution ways. Whic is good for solution better then others or why you can use the solutions etc.

## Guide Overview

The main purpose of this repository is to compare different solutions for LeetCode problems using the Swift programming language, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each solution. It aims to explain how to use these solutions and create a guide on algorithms. At this point, `I recommend that those looking to improve themselves with LeetCode problems first refer to this guide. Please make an effort to solve the problems on your own`. Once you find a solution, it would make sense to compare your solution with those here. Also, keep in mind that this guide has been developed during my own learning process. There may be solutions that I haven't added here because I strive to solve them myself. Therefore, as I discover new approaches, I may update a previously solved problem. If you believe you have found better solutions to those I have already added, please feel free to reach out to me for contributions. My contact information can be found in the Contact section.

## Usage

We actually mentioned the ideal use of this guide in the Guide Overview section. But to repeat, when you’re working on solving LeetCode problems, I recommend that you first try to solve them yourself and find at least one solution. I'm not saying you shouldn’t research how to use certain methods during the coding process. If you don’t know how to use the `filter` method in Swift or if you’ve never heard of it, of course, you should look it up. That’s part of the learning process. However, if you just open ChatGPT and ask it to solve the question for you by copying and pasting, I wonder how much that affects your understanding of algorithms. Similarly, you shouldn’t directly copy answers from this guide.

But if you assume that you've made at least one attempt at a solution, coming here to compare the algorithmic complexity of your solution, checking runtime, and examining the solutions I provide would be a good step for your development. I want to remind you that this guide also reflects my development process on LeetCode problems. So you might not find your solution here or you may have come up with a better solution. In such cases, please feel free to reach out to me using the contact information provided in the contact section for any contributions or feedback.
